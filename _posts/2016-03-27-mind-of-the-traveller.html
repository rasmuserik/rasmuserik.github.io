<p>One of the most powerful tools is an open mind.<br />
It is interesting to think about the different states of mind,<br />
&#8211; one of the is the <em>mind of the traveller</em>, the same state of mind<br />
you have when you are travelling, open for adventure,<br />
very un-busy, exploring the world.</p>
<p>It is also about getting out of the comfort zone,<br />
pushing yourself to go new places.</p>
<p>Last week I heard a talk at toastmasters,<br />
which inspired me to focus on<br />
staying out of the comfort zone,<br />
and in the weekend I went<br />
for a dance event in that state of mind.</p>
<p>The dance was cancelled,<br />
but on my way home I heard music,<br />
and in my <em>mind of the traveller</em>,<br />
I decided to follow the music,<br />
and see where it lead.</p>
<p>The music was old, with great rhythms.<br />
It turned out to be a viking festival,<br />
with live music, <a href="http://www.virelai.dk/" target="_blank">Virelai</a> was playing,<br />
&#8211; they are great musicians, as well as<br />
engaging/connecting with the audience.<br />
Soon there was a k√¶dedans,<br />
(&#8220;chain dance&#8221;, nordic way of dancing),<br />
and even after their performance had ended,<br />
the music continued we were all singing together.</p>
<p>So opening the mind, and setting it into the<br />
exploring way of the traveller, can lead into<br />
beautiful experiences.</p>
