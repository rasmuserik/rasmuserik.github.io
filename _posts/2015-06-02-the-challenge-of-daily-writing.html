<p>Imagine writing something every day. Would it be fun, would it be boring, would you learn from it, and where would it lead? <!--more-->Why would you do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your writing skill.</li>
<li>Practise self discipline.</li>
<li>Share ideas and thoughts others may benefit from.</li>
<li>Learn about the things you write about.</li>
<li>As a form of marketing if you run a business or similar.</li>
<li>Participate in the global discussion, and thereby our collective consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<p>And still, for me, it is both scary and difficult to start on such a habit, so I ask myself, why I do not write regularly yet?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not a writer, &#8211; but writing is the way to becoming one</li>
<li>I will write boring stuff, &#8211; but the reader is not forced to read it, and practice is a way to learn to make it less boring</li>
<li>I want to stay in my comfort zone, &#8211; but the only way to expand my comfort zone is to go beyond it.</li>
<li>I will look stupid with the things I write, &#8211; but I will likely look less stupid than if I do not write at all. Also no expression is also an expression. When I feel like this, it also shows that I am taking myself way to serious.</li>
<li>I do not have time, &#8211; but it will also save time when writing becomes faster and more natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decide to do the experiment and see where it leads. I will make and take this challenge for myself: <strong>Try to write almost every day, and publish it.</strong></p>
<p>My basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add regular writing in the calendar.</li>
<li>First, write anything without any filters or major editing/deleting, then rewrite afterwards.</li>
<li>Decide always to press the &#8220;publish&#8221;-button when writing-time is done, (the text itself is never perfectly done).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
