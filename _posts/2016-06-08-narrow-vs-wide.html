<p>Is the focus narrow or wide?</p>
<p>When you look at the different things you do,<br />
it is sometimes good to be conscious about<br />
whether you choose a wide or narrow focus.</p>
<p><!--more-->Given the same time,<br />
you can acquire high expertise in a detail,<br />
basic skills in general.High expertise is often more valued,<br />
as this is hard to come by,<br />
while general skills may give more growth,<br />
as the rate of improvement is higher.Often it is also best<br />
to focus on improving the area<br />
where you are the weakest.</p>
<p>This is also a reminder for myself,<br />
to think about where to put my focus ðŸ™‚</p>
