<p>Argentine tango introductory class, and milonga (dance evening) at <a href="https://tinkuy.dk">Tinkuy</a>, Skyttegade 3, 2200 Kbh.N, on Wednesday May 13. 7pm.<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>We will work with tango technique, connection, musicality, etc. also with a focus on how it is applicable in other social dances, for example lindy-hop/swing</li>
<li>Barefoot &#8211; no (outdoor) shoes are allowed at the dance place Tinkuy &#8211; this also puts the focus on more straight movements</li>
<li>We both lead and follow within the dance &#8211; following makes you a better leader and leading makes you a better follower. This is sometimes called &#8220;queertango&#8221;, and also eliminate the issue of possible gender imbalance.</li>
<li>It is a social dance, and everybody dances with everybody, &#8211; we will change dance partners regularly during the practise &#8211; you can come with or without a partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to argentine tango &#8211; the focus will be on basic technique and musicality, which is suitable for both beginners and experienced dancers ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Social dancing &#8211; after the introduction it will gradually change into social dancing, both with traditional tango music, and also other music that is good for tango dancing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start at 19:01, so please be here on time.</p>
