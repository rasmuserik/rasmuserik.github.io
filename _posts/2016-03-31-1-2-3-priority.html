<p>One of my favourite tools<br />
for planning and review<br />
is 1-2-3 priorities:</p>
<p>Essentially I have<br />
one major item,<br />
two secondary items, and<br />
three minor items.</p>
<p>Deciding on<br />
what is the primary,<br />
most important item,<br />
is a good exercise,<br />
that makes it easier to focus.</p>
<p>The minor items are usually very small,<br />
but might be something good to remember,<br />
or something that can be done quickly,<br />
but would otherwise be procrastinated.</p>
<p>The limit on the number of items<br />
is important, as it forces you to<br />
cut away low-priority items up front.</p>
<p>1-2-3 is easy to remember,<br />
and the total number of six items,<br />
is in the sweet spot of what we as humans<br />
easily can process in our working memory.</p>
<p>I developed this method of prioritising<br />
a while ago, and is using it regularly,<br />
good effect, so it is definitely something<br />
that I can recommend.<br />
I might also have mentioned itin an earlier post.</p>
<p>A concrete example<br />
of the 1-2-3 prioritisation<br />
can be seen in my<a href="http://blog.solsort.com/2016/03/31/kvartal/"> quarterly review</a>.</p>
