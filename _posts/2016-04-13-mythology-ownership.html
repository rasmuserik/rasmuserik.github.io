<p>Recently, I was reminded about the importance of myth,<br />
when listening to an audio book version of<br />
Campbell&#8217;s <em>The Hero With A Thousand Faces</em>.</p>
<p>This also makes me even more aware<br />
of the choice of mythology that I share with my son.<br />
Currently we are reading fairy tales, and have dived into<br />
Biblical stories, Norse mythology, Aesopâ€™s fables and so on.</p>
<p>Here I consciously choose, the old free culture,<br />
rather than the proprietary stories that he<br />
learn anyhow through kindergarten etc.</p>
<p>Mythology is our cultural basis, and therefore it saddens me<br />
when the cultural heroes of today comes from<br />
Spiderman, Big Hero, Minions, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act#Support">Mickey Mouse</a>,<br />
where the mythology is owned by large corporations,<br />
where you are not even legally allowed to draw the stories yourself.</p>
<p>The old stories are beautiful, and most new mythologies,<br />
are rehashed versions of the classical ones.</p>
<p>Therefore I will encourage to dive into<br />
the old free stories of the world.</p>
