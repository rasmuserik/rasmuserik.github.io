<p>I stumbled upon a &#8220;game&#8221; today: the computer plays 5 notes, and tells what the first is, &#8211; and then you have to name the remaining ones. <!--more-->This this simple ear-training concept is amazingly addictive, and today the afternoon just disappeared, with ear training. Next I found sound tuner software, and practised to try to sing into it, and see which notes I hit. (I am not a singer). This is also very fun, &#8211; trying to see if you hit the notes, and also to find a score, and trying to sing a song in the actual key it is in, just with a songbook and a tuner. This really makes me feel like a beginner, but it is super fun.</p>
