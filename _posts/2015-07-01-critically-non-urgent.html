<p>I sometimes have to remind myself to focus on the non-urgent critical tasks, rather than the urgent non-critical tasks. When prioritising what to do next, <!--more-->distinguishing between urgent and critical helps me a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urgent critical</strong> tasks need to be done now. These usually have no problems of being prioritised.</li>
<li><strong>Non-urgent critical</strong> tasks are important to get done, but can wait a while. For example next months taxes, getting some freelance projects for income, taking basic care of the body by exercising, cleaning kitchen, etc. &#8211; these can end up veryÂ postponed if not careful.</li>
<li><strong>Urgent non-critical</strong> tasks includes replying to most emails, phone etc., going to a class, getting something on sales. Has a tendency to seem more important in the moment due to its urgency, even though other things are more important to get done.</li>
<li><strong>Non-urgent non-critical</strong> tasks are usually easy to sort out when prioritising.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple tool for sorting this out, when having a lot of tasks is to draw two lines to split a paper into four quadrants, &#8211; the critical at the top, and the urgent on the left, and then write each task in the appropriate quadrant.</p>
