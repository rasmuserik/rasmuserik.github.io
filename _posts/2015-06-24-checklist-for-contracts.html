<p>Through experience of  IT-contracts I try to be aware of the following things:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Operational requirements &#8211; the definition of task is clear and preferably even third party verifiable, which makes sure you are on the same page on what will be delivered.</li>
<li>Clearly stated license for code (usually delivered under permissive open source on payment). This protects both you and your client.</li>
<li>Quality assurance, &#8211; make sure that the contract explicitly states the quality of the delivered product in a measurable way, &#8211; for example be performance-wise, code quality, documentation etc.</li>
<li>Structure of agile development process, communication and involvement on both sides. Are we working in sprints, how do we communicate backlog etc., transparency of development.</li>
<li>Document collaborators and clients responsibility, &#8211; what happens with your part and payment,  if your access to are delayed, or other component or the project halts.</li>
<li>Accept/done-criteria, and payment. When is your role fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is an incomplete list, but the points mentioned above have been useful to me when making contracts.</p>
