<p>Looking into making mobile HTML5-apps on top of React/Reagent, and not reinventing the wheel&#8230; these seems to be the:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>TouchstoneJS &#8211; Mobile iOS-like UI-library that seems like the best react-based library (reapp unmaintained, and the rest has much smaller userbase). It is much much less mature than ionicframework or similar, though.</li>
<li>Material-UI &#8211; Material design (Android-like). Seems to be best bet if I want to build apps, and is ok with material design.</li>
<li>Use standard CSS framework, like ratchet, foundation, semantic-ui, or bootstrap.</li>
<li>Reinvent the wheel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking further into to the options: The future of TouchstoneJS is a bit uncertain, due to react native, seeÂ https://github.com/touchstonejs/touchstonejs/issues/87. Material-UI has bad performance on mobile, and ratchet etc. does not really deliver the effects that I want (transitions etc.). So I am still tempted to reinvent the wheel..</p>
