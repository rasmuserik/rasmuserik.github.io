<p>Age is a funny thing, &#8211; and has many sides about it:<!--more--></p>
<p>The feeling of age varies with social contexts, &#8211; in some social circles I feel in similar age as peers in the late forties, and in other social circles I feel in similar age as peers in the early twenties. There are also contexts where I feel generations younger or older then the peers.</p>
<p>Another aspect is how settled you are, &#8211;  being a father makes me grow enormously and adds new aspects and responsibility to my life, &#8211; though my path of life is not the traditional road of settling down, &#8211; then there is the aspect of settling into life.</p>
<p>Then the major point is how ageing  can lead to maturity, experience, and hopefully wisdom, as time goes by.</p>
<p>Then there is the physical age, &#8211; the body changes as time goes by, &#8211; if nothing is done it just slowly decays, but sometimes it can go the other way for a while, if time is taken to care for the physical body.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful things: the way we grow, and expand and disappear at the same time into the universe, &#8211; as a grain of sand on the shores of eternity.</p>
