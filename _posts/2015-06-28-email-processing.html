<p>How do we handle email?<!--more--></p>
<p>I once heard a note about amount of stuff in you inbox, on your working table etc.: <strong>The items to handle to keep an inbox at a fixed level is the same, no matter if the inbox contain 1000 items or zero</strong>. In core: we always has to handle exactly as much as is incoming, so keeping the inbox empty, or the surfaces in our home clean, is the same amount of processing as having a fixed amount of mess. I find it good to remind myself of that fact, even though it does not take batch processing, or time-dependent things into account.</p>
<p>So what does my email processing look like, &#8211; I often skim through to see if there is something critical, and also often do quick email where I just answer things that have a short reply/action and archive anything that do not have any actions. Actions also include adding a task to the todo-list/calendar, reading etc., where tasks like writing longer emails also go to the todo-list. I regularly (usually between daily to up to a couple of weeks between) fully empty the inbox, making sure that everything that I see that needs answer has been done and archived. The last emails are always the most difficult, but it really helps to decide on that it should end up empty.</p>
<p>Having a small and regularly empty email inbox, is really nice because it gives a confidence that there is not laying some email around that is forgotten and needs to be answered. It still happens though, that I archive an email to quickly, or it ends up classified as spam, &#8211; so if you email me, and there is no answer within a couple of week, I probably archived it to fast or it ended in the spam filter, in which case try to contact me again.</p>
<p>Right now there is 3 emails in my inbox, and all of them are waiting for me to plan my calendar, before answering them.</p>
