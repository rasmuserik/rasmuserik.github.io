<p>Parkinsons law states that the amount of resources needed,<!--more--> tend to expand to fit  at least the amount of resources allocated. And though the opposite is not necessarily true, it has a tendency to go in that direction.</p>
<p>In addition, at least for IT projects, it is often the case that the amount of resources needed is roughly twice the amount of resources estimated. &#8211; so a good rule of thumb when estimating is: to try to make as reasonable an estimate as possible, and then double it. In my experience, this has often turned out to be surprisingly accurate.</p>
<p>The inverse of Parkinsons law is also very useful, even if it may not be true &#8211; if resources needed partly shrinks to fit the amount of resources allocated, then having short deadlines for parts of project, or limit time or other resources, could help in efficiency. I would not like to do that on a business or full project level, as it might lead to stress, &#8211; but on a personal level I find it very helpful.</p>
<p>A concrete example is my challenge of daily writing practice: The last couple of days it has taken too much of my time, so today I attempt to limit my writing time  to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Another effect of allocating a concrete time limit to a task is, that it also helps you get started. Psychologically, after I winded up the kitchen timer, and it starts ticking, I feel I have to focus on the task and start working on it immediately. A surprisingly difficult part of many tasks is to actually get started on it, &#8211; and it is feels way easier to say: I will only do 15 minutes of boring tasks now, than to say I will do this boring task, &#8211; even if it in reality only to takes 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And this concludes the post, 25 minutes after I started, with 5 minutes left to read it through.</p>
