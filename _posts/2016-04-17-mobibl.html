<p>A while ago I decided to make<br />
a public library web/app.</p>
<p>You can see the prototype in progress on<br />
<a href="https://apps.solsort.com/mobibl/">https://apps.solsort.com/mobibl/</a>.<br />
It does not have a backend yet,<br />
so searching, ordering, etc. does not work.</p>
<p>The source code, and progress tracking, is:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/solsort/mobibl/">https://github.com/solsort/mobibl/</a>.</p>
<p>The initial design has 4 views:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Search.</em> A primary reason to use it is to find a book/material that you want to borrow/order. An innovation here is to make the facets much more prominent, and an active part of the search, right beneath / almost as a part of the search bar.</li>
<li><em>Creative Work.</em> Focus on a book or other material. Clean design with focus on the content. Also includes history of previously visited works on top, and related materials in the bottom.</li>
<li><em>Library</em>. The map of libraries is primary, as it both enables the user to select library, and also helps the user to find/navigate to the library. Then it contains meta information (and later news/events) of the library.</li>
<li><em>User.</em> User status ordered by use cases: 1) arrived books, 2) renewal/due loans, 3) ordered books.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this weekend, that is my main focus.</p>
