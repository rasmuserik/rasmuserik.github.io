<p>If I were to write some notes for my son about life, what could it contain?<!--more--></p>
<p>This is just a quick brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existentialism, God, and science. God is, &#8211; but what is it? Bits of philosophy too, and inspirations.
<ul>
<li>Is there some kind of God or divine purpose. We cannot prove this, so it is a question of believe. So the question boils down to: will your life be most meaningful on the assumption that is a purely mechanical universe, or that it a universe with some kind of higher intention.</li>
<li>Quotes, sources, and approaches to God that I think catches some of the mystical essense, and which I find inspirational</li>
<li>What is the mysticism, the union with God, and the quest of catching it.</li>
<li>The existential pain and how to cope with it.</li>
