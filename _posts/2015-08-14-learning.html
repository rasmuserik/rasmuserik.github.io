<p>I like to learn. Currently I am looking into several different directions: <!--more--></p>
<p>There are always more technical / theoretical stuff to focus on, &#8211; here I am currently looking into user interfaces and functional reactive programming. A very nice resource in that area is <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame">https://github.com/Day8/re-frame</a>. This is a framework for building ClojureScript apps, but also goes to a great length explaining the paradigm. &#8211; this is actually one of my favourite parts about Clojure, that things are often very thought through, and brilliantly explained, so I learn a lot from it.</p>
<p>Another study that I have started to look into recently, is a coursera-course about learning. during the daily writes a couple of days ago, I thought that I should use the daily writing as a tool for learning, &#8211; so I started browsing coursera for interesting courses, and found some. The first one that I am looking into is &#8220;Learning how to learn&#8221;, &#8211; I guess I like meta levels. It is also nice when doing practical stuff, &#8211; I went through the content of the week during dishwashing/cooking while my son was sleeping. This is the main takeaways that I remember now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The distinction between focussed and diffuse thinking, which are two empirically  distinct modes of thinking.</li>
<li>Reminder of pomodoro method (I already knew that from a junto meeting, but did not have as much emphasis on reward after the pomodoro, as the course had)</li>
<li>The usual stuff that the sleep, exercise, and social context, are all important in learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course is at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn</a> if you are curious about the details.</p>
