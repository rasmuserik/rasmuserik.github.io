<p>I ended using WordPress for this blog and will probably also begin to use it for building other solutions as well.</p>
<p>WordPress is especially interesting because<!--more--> of the large community and user base around it. This means that it is easier to find other designers/developers who are familiar with the technology, so it is possible to hand off tasks if things get too busy or boring. There is also a market for plugins, etc., and there are many existing solutions built on this technology &#8211; this is both interesting as a target market for building stuff to, and also as market to use when building solution, so I wont have to implement as many features on request. The trade-of is that there is a lot of competition in the field.</p>
<p>The critical features are fulfilled by WordPress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy content management, that allows clients to update/manage the content themselves.</li>
<li>REST-API, so html5 widgets/apps I build, can talk directly with the CMS.</li>
<li>Multisite installs, so I can easily host solution, without too much hassle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other obvious choice could have been Drupal. The difference between these two are actually which kind of solutions I want to work with. At the moment I prefer to work with small companies and independents, who usually just need simple solutions which is the sweet spot for WordPress, whereas Drupal is better for larger more complex solutions. Drupal would be a better choice if the target was to earn money, as there seem to be less competition and higher prices there.</p>
<p>Of course there are tons of other interesting CMS solutions, but these two seem to have the major mind share and market here. If I was just focusing on building my own web solutions, I would choose something with more interesting technology, as php/mysql are not my personal favourites, but as a pragmatic choice this is probably the best, &#8211; especially when I am wantto deliver hand-off&#8217;able solutions, and my main development related to it will be to build widgets/apps on top of its APIs.</p>
