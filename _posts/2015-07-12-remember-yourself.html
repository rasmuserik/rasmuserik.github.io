<p>Just a personal reminder<br />
that might be applicable<br />
to other people too:<!--more--></p>
<p>Remember yourself.</p>
<p>&#8211; if you are very empathic,<br />
it might happen that you feel<br />
other persons feelings<br />
as if they were your own.<br />
This is both good and bad.</p>
<p>It allows you to connect<br />
and see the world<br />
from another side.</p>
<p>But it also has the danger<br />
of loosing oneself.</p>
<p>Therefore it is important,<br />
to stop up and feel,<br />
what comes from the environment<br />
and what comes from yourself.<br />
Remember what you want,<br />
and do not just follow the flow.</p>
<p>Be more selfish,<br />
such that you do<br />
what is important<br />
for your-self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
