<p>About a week ago, I changed my systems for structure and planning. The tools Org-mode and Habitica, &#8211; and this is how I use them:<!--more--></p>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1">Org-mode</h2>
<div id="text-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p><a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is a part of <a href="https://rasmuserik.com/2016/06/27/tools-for-text-editing">Emacs</a> tools for outlining, time-tracking, note-taking, project-planning, todo-lists, authoring, etc.</p>
<p>I keep my calendar in the outline mode, with a separate level for sections-of-life, quarters, half-months, and days/sprints, &#8211; this gives a good overview and planning.</p>
<p>I also use the time tracking capabilities to track how much time I use on different work-tasks and similar stuff. There is both a buitlin timer, as well as a pomodoro-clock, &#8211; which is useful fo getting into work mode.</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">Habitica</h2>
<div id="text-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p><a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a> is a habit-tracker with some gamification elements, &#8211; and I only use the daily-tasks elements of it, where I have three types of tasks:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>exercises: I keep track of my exercise routine</li>
<li>work: I have a number of tasks, corrosponding to the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoros</a> / half-hours of work, I want to do per day.</li>
<li>practical checklist: such as have a clean kitchen, no screen time in the evening, empty inbox, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The daily tasks are only in the weekdays (not Sunday). I also added a daily extraction/copy of habitica data, such that I can do statistics later on.</p>
