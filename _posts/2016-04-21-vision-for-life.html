<p>Where will you be years from now?<br />
What is your direction?</p>
<p>The goal that I am moving towards is<br />
a life style of creating and learning,<br />
centred around short projects.</p>
<p>Mastering going from idea to initial execution<br />
in a matter of days or weeks.</p>
<p>Walking into a contexts,<br />
quickly deliver good solutions,<br />
and then continue onwards,<br />
focusing on the iteration of creation.</p>
<p>These months I work intensely<br />
on a couple of larger projects,<br />
which have the effect of improving<br />
my toolbox for rapid development<br />
as well as giving me an economic buffer,<br />
finishing the foundation I will build upon.</p>
<p>This paves the path for my journey,<br />
going further towards the archetype<br />
of the wandering wizard.</p>
