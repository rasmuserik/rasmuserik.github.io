<p>I had a talk with a friend, which really made me aware of the intuitive/sensing personality trait, and why it is very useful<!--more--> to be conscious about it.</p>
<p>We were conversing, and I found it difficult to find the right words. This was because I was intuitive about the ideas in a general sense without the practical examples, whereas she would have liked a focus on more concrete details to get a sense of it. This lead our topic into personality traits, especially intuitive/sensing dimension which this was a clear example of, and being aware of this actually made the conversation even better.</p>
<p>Being more &#8220;intuitive&#8221; or &#8220;sensing&#8221; is a way to describe how you perceive or think about the world.</p>
<p><strong>Sensing</strong> is when your approach is rooted in the senses, more concrete and factual. The things, examples, and actual situations are what really makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive</strong> is to have more focus on the abstract ideas, and general concepts. It is the patterns and underlying structure that matters that stays in mind, and you might almost forget the concrete examples, when you find the general intuition.</p>
<p>Of course you have both aspects, and one or the other can be predominant at times. In the conversation before, it was very clear that I had an intuitive state of mind, whereas she had more a sensing state, which made it difficult to put things words. This really served as a reminder for me to be aware to have more senses in my communication and thinking.</p>
<p>So the takeaway here is that sometimes we are more concrete or abstract, and it might be good to be conscious about this, both to improve our communication and our thinking.</p>
