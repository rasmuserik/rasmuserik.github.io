<p>A recent habit,<br />
that pushes me forward,<br />
is the daily check list.</p>
<p>It is simple:<br />
I have a list of things<br />
I want to do every day,and then check them off.</p>
<p>The things on my list include:</p>
<ul>
<li>body: exercise, breakfast, etc.</li>
<li>tidyness: empty inbox, clean kitchen etc.</li>
<li>mind: gratitude, no evening screen-time, review/plan of the day, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having an explicit list,<br />
and checking it of daily<br />
is surprisingly effective.<br />
When the system is in place,<br />
it is also surprisingly easy<br />
to start a new habit:<br />
just add it to the list.</p>
<p>I have had a shorter informal check list<br />
in my calendar/day-log, which worked well,<br />
but recently a friend asked me to join that I tried<br />
an online open source check-list &#8220;game&#8221;,<br />
<a href="https://habitica.com/" target="_blank">Habitica</a> which has a higher ease of use,<br />
(syncs/runs across different devices),<br />
which turns out to be very useful.</p>
<p>Concluding tips for running a daily check list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>First priority is to make the check list itself a daily habit</li>
<li>Only have things on the check list that you actually will do (almost) every day</li>
<li>Ease of checking in is important, &#8211; switching from having it in my calendar, to a dedicated(one-click) synced check list increased effectiveness a lot</li>
<li>Can also be used to negate bad habits, where you check that you do not do it</li>
<li>It is a very good tool to add/manage habits</li>
</ul>
