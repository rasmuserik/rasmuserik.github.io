<p>I recently heard the concept &#8220;Ninja Gig&#8221;, which is a performance decided on, and improvised with very short notice. I believe the term was coined by Amanda Palmer. It targets music performance, but it could as well be applicable to software development.</p>
<p>What I really like about it, is the freedom it brings along. Decide on whether or what to do in the moment, being present in the now.</p>
<p>How could this be applicable to software development? You need to be capable to deliver a solution with very short notice. It could be an app, a website, statistical results of data mining, or other concrete product.</p>
<p>Then the step is just to spot a need, or another way to help people, then with short notice build a first version of the solution, bring it into production and deliver it.</p>
<p>Possible leads for ideas and directions are hackerthons, start-up-weekends, and also just talking with people about their digital needs.</p>
<p>I have been working towards this approach for a while, before knowing that there existed this word for it. Currently I am improving on my toolbox to be more efficient in this direction: ClojureScript for HTML5-apps, and docker for deployment of various solutions.</p>
<p>At the moment I am working on a larger library project, and as soon as this end I will (most likely) try to focus on doing ninja gigs ðŸ™‚ Which I have the feeling will fit well in my lifestyle.</p>
