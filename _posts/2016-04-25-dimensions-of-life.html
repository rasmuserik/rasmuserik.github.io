<p>An interesting question to ask oneself is:</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the major dimensions of your life?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you look into you past, what are the areas that you have dived into, and which of these are active at the moment?</p>
<p>Making a brainstorm about this,<br />
and writing it down,<br />
can make you more aware of<br />
yourself and where your focus are.</p>
<p>It could also be an interesting exercise,<br />
to do this with other, and discuss the result.</p>
<p>The major dimensions that pops into my mind,<br />
about my life in the past and the present, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>*Software Development<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>*Dance/exercise/body<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>*Fatherhood<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>*Executive/business<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Computer Science / Mathematics<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Outdoor/nature/cycling/larp/swim<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Design/making/2d/3d<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Self-development/psychology/structure/discipline<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Teaching/public-speaking/storytelling/writing<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>Religion/mythology/philosophy/mysticism<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>•Games/board/rpg<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>•Romance/women</em></li>
<li><em>•Social/conversational/dinner-parties/cooking<br />
</em></li>
<li><em>•Music/bass/piano/guitar<br />
</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>*</em> indicates that those are the most active ones.<br />
The <em>•</em> indicates the currently dormant ones.</p>
