<p>WhenÂ packaging Clojure/ClojureScript modules:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous integration testing can be done with travis-ci for open source projects. Just add a .travis.yml to the project which runs the tests, log in on travis-ci.org with github, and enable the project, &#8211; then every time you push a commit, the tests will be run automatically, and you will get a warning if something is wrong.</li>
<li>Dependency tracking can be done with jarkeeper, ie. visiting jarkeeper.com/$GITHUB_USER/$PROJECT_NAME will show you whether the modules dependency is up to date.</li>
<li>Clojars is the communityÂ maven repository for open source clojure modules, &#8211; this is where you easily can distribute your libraries etc. just run &#8220;lein depluy clojars&#8221; and it is up there, and can easily be found/used by other projects ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Github badges, &#8211; you can various dynamic information to the README on github, &#8211; by linking to certain images on travis, jarkeeper and clojars, your project page can show live status for unit testing, dependency tracking, and latest installableÂ version of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>WhenÂ using Clojure + ClojureScriptÂ together:</p>
<ul>
<li>cljs.test is now available, so you can use the same test framework within ClojureScript and Clojure</li>
<li>Feature expressions has landed, so you can make cljc files, which works both in Clojure and ClojureScript</li>
<li>Take a look atÂ <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide">best practices</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Example project, that I am working on toÂ learn how to make modules for ClojureScript, is available on <a href="https://github.com/rasmuserik/hello-module">https://github.com/rasmuserik/hello-module</a></p>
