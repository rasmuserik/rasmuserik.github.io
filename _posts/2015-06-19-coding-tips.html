<p>Some tips for coding, &#8211; first I wanted to remind myself<!--more--> not to build a platform until I need it (even when it has some very interesting research-like aspects), and then I started to remember several other best practices that I try follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solve problems, do not build platforms</strong> or libraries to begin with. When you solve the same kind of problem again, and again,  the common structure will emerge, &#8211; so wait until then, with refactoring the solutions to extract the library.</li>
<li>Learn the standard way of sharing the code in the environment you work within. How do you use and publish open source on the central code repository. (clojars, github, etc.)</li>
<li>Get to know your tools, &#8211; your editor, and build tools, and environment.</li>
<li>Decouple, and extract as modules.</li>
<li>Use automated testing, and integration server.</li>
<li>Have a structured way to handle issues and tasks in your code, &#8211; and be able to visualise the proress.</li>
<li>Automate test, staging and deploy workflow as much as possible.</li>
<li>Document, including overall workflow and architecture.</li>
<li>Release often.</li>
<li>Avoid reinventing the wheel. NiH.</li>
<li>Make it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Deleting a line of code is often more productive than writing one. Do not be afraid to throw away code.</li>
</ul>
