<p>Just a subset of the half-monthly review. This is mostly personal notes,<!--more--> but some people might find it interesting, and by stating my tasks publicly, it adds an external responsibility as an internal motivation to fulfil them.</p>
<p>Some plans/tasks for the coming two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily habits: continue public daily writing and code commits, and also make morning exercise a truly daily practice</li>
<li>Start using facebook, &#8211; update status and begin to login weekly. Overcome the worst aversions against walled-garden monopoly, and giving up on personal data</li>
<li>Create/code dashboard for solsort.com (task carried over from last half-month)</li>
<li>Take a look at the tinkuy ruby code if time permits</li>
<li>Visit Vestjylland and my mother (with my son)</li>
<li>Practical tasks at home</li>
</ul>
<p>Public status from the preceding two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started public daily writing practice</li>
<li>Begun on wordpres: installed a blog, and wrote code for a child-theme, and a plugin + widget</li>
<li>Added more info in the /bibdata site</li>
<li>Ensured that the backup of the server logs+db runs automatically</li>
<li>Progressed on dance practice: stronger separation of hip/chest/head-level movement and spine, discovering/reinventing social dance moves, focus, etc.</li>
<li>Visited grandmother, had sibling-jam-session, etc. (with my son)</li>
<li>Did <strong>not</strong> make the solsort.com dashboard as planned</li>
</ul>
