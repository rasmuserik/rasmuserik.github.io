<p>When I started to write here,<br />
the purpose was to become a better writer.<br />
It turns out to have other<br />
unexpected good side-effects:</p>
<p>It adds time for reflection.<br />
When you put thoughts into writing,<br />
you have to think them through in another way.</p>
<p>It preserves thoughts across time,<br />
so you can have a dialog with yourself<br />
another place in time.</p>
<p>A recent post was an example of this.<br />
In the previous months, I have had<br />
consultancy/contracting work,<br />
which collided with my 3-day sprints.<br />
Yesterday when I was writing about<br />
&#8220;Hierarkisk tid&#8221;, I thought the work structure,<br />
and reread my &#8220;3-day sprint&#8221; post,<br />
that I linked to. This made me think,<br />
and move the sprints around,<br />
so they fit much better to the work.</p>
