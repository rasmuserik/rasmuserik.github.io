<p>I just rediscovered a very useful tool for learning: <!--more-->recording yourself.</p>
<p>When thinking about it, then it is so obvious, &#8211; but I am rarely doing it nonetheless. Maybe I rarely do it because it feels silly seeing/hearing oneself. Maybe I rarely do it because I am not ready for that kind of self-criticism. But it is immensely good feedback, when you get around to do it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did it in the context of dancing, &#8211; and now I know very clearly things that I need to work on about my posture, my connection, and the way I walk.</p>
<p>When I was practising public speaking in toastmasters, I also recorded myself during the speech preparation, and this was also one of the best tools for improving.</p>
<p>This is a tool in the toolbox, and I often forget to use it, though it is super powerful. So a reminder for you (and myself next time I read this post): record yourself, and review it for better practising and learning.</p>
