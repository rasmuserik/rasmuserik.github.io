<p>Playing games is nice pastime, &#8211; these are games which I have at home, like to play, and would recommend to try out:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Robo Rally</strong> is a robot &#8220;racing&#8221; game, &#8211; you make plans all the players robots move at the same time, which often end up in a funny slapstick-like mess of robots pushing each other in directions you never expected.</p>
<p><strong>The Resistance</strong> is a social game, where you have to figure out who are on the same team. You have to read people, and the games can be very different, &#8211; it is a bit similar to Werewolf/Mafia-games, but no one are eliminated during the game, which is a huge boon.</p>
<p><b>Combigame</b> is my version of a <strong>Set</strong>-like pattern-spotting game, a multi player puzzle solving where you can also jump in and out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>(Zombie) Flux</strong> is a funny card game, full of zombies, where the rules changes, and which you can join in during the game play.</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong> is one of the best two-player strategy game. It is an classical game, in the same category as chess.  The rules are very simple, but the game-play has immense depths. Also, it is possible to give advantage to a player, so both players can have a challenging game, even if they are on different levels.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder</strong> (beginner box) is a pen-and-paper role playing game, and the beginner box has some simplified rules for easy getting started.</p>
<p><strong>Twister</strong> is a game where you twist your body, and a good way to get moving, &#8211; also playable by very young children.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> is a classical strategy game, &#8211; can take quite long to play though.</p>
<p><strong>Carcassonne</strong> is good as a relaxing tile-laying board game, also nice for two players.</p>
<p><strong>Classical card games</strong>, such as poker, pirat-whist, are also fun, &#8211; and card tricks can be a fun practise too.</p>
<p><strong>EuroCards</strong> is my attempt on an educational top-trumps-like card game, where you learn about the European countries at the same time.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Lifestyle&#8221;</b> is a game where you have to guess each others preferences in various aspect of life. Good for getting to know people more, &#8211; found this in a second-hand shop, and have not really seen it other places, &#8211; whereas the other games are somewhat more mainstream.</p>
