<p>An important thing I have to remind myself time after time is: <!--more--><strong>Keep it simple.</strong></p>
<p>A dangerous pitfall, that is easy to fall into, is to strive for the perfect solution, or a better way to do things, and in the process use more time, that it would have taken just to get done with it.</p>
<p>In computer science there is a saying: when in doubt use brute force, &#8211; allegedly coined by one of the fathers of the Unix operating system, and many programming languages. This is similar in principle of &#8220;keep it simple&#8221;. Computers are immensely fast, so the best way to get something done is often just to use the stupid simple approach, and that will be fast enough and spend less time.</p>
<p>Also, if you start with the simple solution, you will either succeed, or get to know the problem better when realising whether simple solution is sufficient.</p>
