<p>Remember not to<br />
run the engines on 100%<br />
all the time.</p>
<p>It may be awesome<br />
and the way to go for a while,but there also needs time<br />
for experiences to cool down<br />
and settle in.</p>
<p>So try to vary the intensity,<br />
and have time for restoration,<br />
recharging and reflection.</p>
