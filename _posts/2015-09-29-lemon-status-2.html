<p>This a quick write-up about software development on the lemon-project since <a href="http://solsort.com/2015/09/07/lemon-status-1">last status</a>, 3 weeks ago. There have been progress in several directions:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> There has been a lot of progress on the development infrastructure, and I am currently pushing prototypes to production through my solsort website. I have also set up CouchDB for storing data which can be sync&#8217;ed to app and website.</li>
<li><strong>App:</strong> I made a simple proof-of-concept / technology preview of the lemon app, which can be seen <a href="http://solsort.com/app.html#solsort:lemon">here</a>. Very early prototype, only really tested on high-end android, chrome and firefox.</li>
<li><strong>Tinkuy:</strong> have added initial code for adding html5-widgets to the site, (plus various other changes), &#8211; pushed to github, but not in production yet.</li>
</ul>
