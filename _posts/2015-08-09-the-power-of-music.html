<p>Often efficient working is connected to certain states of mind. A productivity hack that I often use is to <!--more--> connect the focussed work mode to certain kinds of music. So for example when I need to write/type something fast, I have one piece of music I put on, &#8211; another one for house work, and a couple of others more thinking / slower ones.</p>
<p>This makes an unconscious connection between the work focus and the music, so whenever I put the music on, I know that I am in work mode.</p>
<p>Another good use for music is that it can be used for handling emotions. In so when there is a lot of feeling boiling inside, a good way to find calmness, is to find some music that resonates with the emotions and thereby work them through.</p>
<p>And then of course, music is also good to move and dance to. And when I have difficulties pulling myself together on certain task, it helps to put on the corresponding music. This is a productivity hack that I know works well, and should remember to do more often.</p>
