<p>I recently looked at the different activities, that I am involved in, tried to find patterns. There are four different categories that I want to focus on (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>My son, &#8211; spending time and doing activities with him.</li>
<li>Myself, &#8211; self development, new experiences, and all the practical stuff at home etc.</li>
<li>Work projects, &#8211; things that might put bread on the table in the long run, mainly with Computer Science.
<ul>
<li>ClojureScript/Clojure development</li>
<li>Focus on web/apps and some data processing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vision projects, &#8211; things that I want to create for the impact and Computer Science interest
<ul>
<li>Touch oriented &#8220;programming language&#8221;</li>
<li>Reactive distributed persistent database / approach distributed computing, &#8211; based on persistent data structure + ipfs + CRDTs. Very useful for reagent-based apps, and also good foundation for other projects.</li>
<li>Network of gratitude + meta information. Has aspects of alternative valuta, and social network, but quite different at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I intend to use this, such that in every sprint, I choose one direction that is the primary focus. In additions to the sprints, I also look into habits, which are orthogonal to this.</p>
