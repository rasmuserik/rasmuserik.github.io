<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org">https://letsencrypt.org</a> is an awesome initiative, to enable encryption on webservers, by making certificates freely available. It is supported by Mozilla, EFF, and several others.</p>

<p>I joined the beta, and today I created a certificate for my server. Not only does it give you free certificates, but it also just worked flawlessly out of the box, &#8211; it just took a couple of minutes &#8211; much easier than any other certificate issuer that I have tried. I can highly recommend it, &#8211; you can sign up for the beta <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/letsencrypt.org/forms/d/15Ucm4A20y2rf9gySCTXD6yoLG6Tba7AwYgglV7CKHmM">here</a> (<a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/beta-program-announcements/1631">more info</a>), or wait until it goes live in December.</p>
