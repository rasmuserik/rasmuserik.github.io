<p>When doing daily writing,<br />
sometimes it happens,that I am out of inspiration,<br />
and not sure where to start writing.</p>
<p>A counter-move against this<br />
is to have a list of possible writing topics or area<br />
to get yourself started.</p>
<p>So this is a list of ideas (for myself)<br />
to help brainstorm a subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sources of the topic
<ul>
<li>Recent experiences that taught me a lesson.</li>
<li>Books, films, or similar I have seen.</li>
<li>What have I observed recently that I can learn from</li>
<li>Challenges I meet and need to overcome</li>
<li>Look back into what I have written recently and look for patterns</li>
<li>Interesting facts, and knowledge</li>
<li>Actually working through a question, or similar that I want to look at</li>
<li>Go through my notes, and see what pops up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typical subject areas
<ul>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Productivity and self-development</li>
<li>Self-reflection</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
