<p>Habitica is good for making habits<br />
but it has one major shortcoming:<br />
it does not save historical data.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This was a deal breaker for me,<br />
as I want to be able to do data mining<br />
on my own habit data later on.</p>
<p>After not using it for a while,<br />
to day I got around to see<br />
how to save the historical data myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately Habitica exposes an API,<br />
so extracting the data for the current day is as easy as:</p>
<pre>curl -X GET -H 'x-api-user: XXX' -H 'x-api-key: YYY' https://habitica.com/export/userdata.json</pre>
<p>Which I added today to the crontab on my server,<br />
appending it to a file every night,<br />
so now I can switch the recording the habits<br />
from my notes to Habitica again.</p>
