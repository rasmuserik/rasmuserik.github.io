<p>A project idea that I have had laying around for a while is a <strong>network of gratitude</strong>:<!--more--></p>
<p>The core idea is that when I feel in gratitude to you, I can digitally say that I owe you something like a dinner, or I owe you thanks for hosting me while travelling etc. And then, when you also say whom/what you are grateful for, &#8211; it is possible for me to repay the favour by doing something good for someone else ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Another aspect is that when I am making an event, or do something for people I do not know well, then instead of them feeling in debt or maybe even bringing flowers or wine(which I am not good at appreciating). If they can see whom I am in gratitude from, or what causes I believe in, &#8211; then they know that they can just repay the favour in another direction if opportunity arises.</p>
<p>There is also the network effect, &#8211; so if I know that you are gratitude to somebody, whom I have helped in the past, then I will feel less shy about asking you for help.</p>
<p>How could this be implemented? I believe it would make sense to digital it as a digital open organic decentralised barter economy. <strong>Digital</strong> in the sense that machines are very good at working with large networks, and keeping track of relations. <strong>Open</strong> both in the sense of openness of data and infrastructure, and thereby also open about whom I am in gratitude to. The openness is also the guaranteeing factor that protects against misuse. <strong>Organic economy</strong> in the sense if you owe me a favour, and never get around to repay it, then it does not matter, &#8211; organic economy has the technical meaning that the virtual money loose value over time, which encourage spending / paying it forward. <strong>Decentralised economy</strong> in the everybody can create a digital I owe you, &#8211; ie. the trust of value of the gratitude-credits lays within you and me and the individual people and organisations, instead of trust of money from a centralised bank. <strong>Barter economy</strong> in the sense that gratitude is not connected to a specific amount of money, but more that I owe you something in the size of a dinner.</p>
<p>This is just a crazy thought at the moment, but could be interesting to look more into someday. Feel free to tell me if you think it could fun / interesting, and would be enthusiastic about using it, if it ever happens to become more than an idea.</p>
