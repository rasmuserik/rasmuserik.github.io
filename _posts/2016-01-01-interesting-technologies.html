<p>A couple of emerging technologies<!--more--><br />
that looks very promising, and which I will keep an eye on<br />
in the coming year are: IPFS and WebAssembly.</p>
<p>IPFS is a distributed, content addressable  data storage.<br />
The current version is implemented in Go,<br />
&#8211; and is progress of getting implemented in JavaScript.<br />
This could become a base to build decentralised applications.</p>
<p>WebAssembly is a low-level/intermediate language<br />
complementing JavaScript, &#8211; which has the features<br />
necessary to make optimised code.<br />
Where JavaScript is the scripting language,<br />
WebAssembly will likely become the compilation target,<br />
and what you write, when you need extra bits of performance.</p>
