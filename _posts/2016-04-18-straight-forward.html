<p>I have never really been goal oriented,<br />
just followed the inspiration.</p>
<p>Recently I am working a lot,<br />
on consulting work, my own projects, etc.<br />
With a clear vision of direction and focus.<br />
It also means that I cut away other things:<br />
playing music, being social, hosting, cooking,<br />
in exchange for progress in other areas.</p>
<p>It is a pendulum,<br />
now some aspects of life are rising,<br />
while other are dormant.- later there will be time for that<br />
which is postponed now.</p>
<p>That is an aspect of the cycle of life.</p>
<p>Actually I have a vision of<br />
and where I want to go,<br />
which sets my direction<br />
for the coming months,<br />
leaving little space<br />
for anything else.</p>
<p>This is odd for me ðŸ™‚</p>
