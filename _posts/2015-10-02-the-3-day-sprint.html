<p>I have decide to switch to 3-day sprints, and try out how that works.</p>
<p>What is a 3-day sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 days focused work</li>
<li>a unit of work with a concrete deadline</li>
<li>write-up with demo of progress</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more-->This is long enough time to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a simple delivery (prototype, concrete progress on feature, etc.)</li>
<li><a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-First-20-Hours-How-to-Learn">Start learning a new skill</a></li>
<li>Include initiation/demo/retrospective without taking too much overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is short enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be able to put most other things aside and single-task during the sprint</li>
<li>to get a lot of measuring point of what can be done per sprint</li>
<li>to dedicate sprints to minor projects og give away</li>
<li>that I can give satisfaction guarantee on delivered sprints without too much of a risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It fits my calendar very well, with common sprints Mon-Wed(Thu) and some Fri-Sun(Mon), as I dedicate Thursdays afternoon/evening, and every other weekend, to spend with my son.</li>
<li>It can become a concrete product I can offer, &#8211; and write-ups on previous 3-day sprints will make expected scope of delivery very clear.</li>
<li>I think it will fit my way of working very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Structural features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporal placement: Mon.-Wed., Fri.-Sun., Mon.afternoon-Thu.morning, or Fri.noon-Mon.early-morning. With focus on project from very early morning, until late afternoon.</li>
<li>Sprint structure
<ol>
<li>Initiation: define/clarify area of focus, and what to work on. Start continually updated post with notes on sprint.</li>
<li>Actual work</li>
<li>Demo/retrospective/write-up on sprint progress and results</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Types: hackathon(hack4dk,startup-weekend,etc.), improve-own-tools, tinkuy, open-source-project, hired/paid.</li>
</ul>
