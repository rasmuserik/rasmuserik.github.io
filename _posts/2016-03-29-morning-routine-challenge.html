<p>A current challenge<br />
that I set myself is,<br />
to improve my morning routine.</p>
<p>To do this there are three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>plan the morning routine</li>
<li>try it out, and keep track of how I am doing it</li>
<li>review, and see if it is improved and makes sense</li>
</ol>
<p>So the first question is,<br />
what do I want to do in the morning?<br />
What is the plan?</p>
<p>After some consideration,<br />
my optimal morning routine,<br />
should take about 1Â½-2 hours,<br />
and consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>get out of bed</li>
<li>morning exercise</li>
<li>bath/groom/breakfast/etc.</li>
<li>review/plan</li>
<li>writing</li>
</ul>
<p>So next task is to<br />
try it out for a while,<br />
and see how it goes.</p>
