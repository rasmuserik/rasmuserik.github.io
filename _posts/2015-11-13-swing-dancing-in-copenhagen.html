<p>A quick write-up on the different places to dance swing in Copenhagen</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>There are two online calendars for swing dancing in Copenhagen:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://swingdans.dk/index.php?Itemid=153">http://swingdans.dk/index.php?Itemid=153</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.swingshoes.dk/kalender-swingarrangementer/">http://www.swingshoes.dk/kalender-swingarrangementer/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some events are only on one of them, or the other (most are on both).</p>
<p>Here is my personal impression of some of the regular events that happens at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday &#8211; Idrætsfabrikken: Many dancers come directly from class, and the dancing happens in a gym, so not so much atmosphere. The level varies depending on which class has just ended. Can also be a good place to pick up new moves and varitions. There has also been live music and extra classes, which is awesome.</li>
<li>Tuesday &#8211; Studenterhuset: Has drop-in introduction, and is in a cafe, which adds a nice atmosphere. My favorite place to dance at the moment. The floor can be a bit crowded sometimes, and the level is mixed (more beginners early, more advanced later).</li>
<li>Thursday &#8211; Idrætsfabrikken: Same as Monday, just shorter time (in practice it is from 10pm to 11pm), &#8211; I have only been there two times.</li>
<li>Saturday &#8211; Vesterbro Kulturhus: Mainly for practising, &#8211; even includes instructor you can ask. Bring a dance partner, if you want to make sure that there are somebody to dance with.</li>
<li>Sunday &#8211; Kulturhuset Indre by: Social dancing, similar to studenterhuset, but larger, and less beginners(usually no intro, and probably not a place where non-dancers randomly drop in). First Sunday in the month is special though as it include intro (and right before the swing-event has a tango event with intro too).</li>
</ul>
