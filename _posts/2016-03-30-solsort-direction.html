<p>What is the solsort.company,<br />
and where is it heading?</p>
<p>I see solsort.com ApS as an infrastructure<br />
for collaborating, and building solutions.</p>
<hr />
<p>It has values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Openness and transparency. Do <em>as much as possible</em> publicly, in the open, including source code, data, project tracking</li>
<li>Passion over profit. Good/human/social impact and interesting challenges matters more than economic yield</li>
</ul>
<p>It has products:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;App&#8221;-development, targeting web, Android, iOS and other platforms. Focus is on rapid development of fully-functional prototypes/apps</li>
<li>Computer Science consulting in general</li>
</ol>
<p>It has Computer Science focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming &#8211;Â  more expressive, yielding faster development. Primarily using Clojure/ClojureScript, though other languages are also used when they are more practical.</li>
<li>Reactive programming &#8211; for UI, using React/ReactNative/Cordova for creating Web/Native/Hybrid apps</li>
<li>Data mining and analysis &#8211; finding patterns in data, and empirical studies, are good sources for innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>It has utility:</p>
<ul>
<li>A legal entity, handling accounting, contracts, capable of acting in the corporate space</li>
<li>A technical infrastructure, hosting services, distributing apps</li>
<li>A common face/brand for independent people collaborating</li>
<li>A technical and entrepreneurial community</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I have recently begun to collaborate more with other independent developers / computer scientist on delivering projects. Previously solsort.com ApS was just a corporate entity for myself. The change is still in the progress, but the vision is to change solsort into a community/collaboration/infrastructure for independent developers/entrepreneurs with shared values.</p>
