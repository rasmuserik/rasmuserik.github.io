<p>The preceding half-month, I tried out a new life-hack: have an alarm clock ringing in the early evening, and then do not interact with computers etc. after that time. This habit has some very good side-effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Even better sleep &#8211; light from digital displays in the evening really affects our sleep-rhythm.</li>
<li>Being more social, and reading more books &#8211; when I cannot use the computer in the evening, it is more likely that I go out and dance, or read stuff, or practice music, etc. in the evening.</li>
<li>More efficient time at the computer, &#8211; with a clear limit on computing time, I prioritise and focus more when using it.</li>
</ul>
