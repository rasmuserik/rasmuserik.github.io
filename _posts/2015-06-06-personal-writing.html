<p>Usually I try to keep as objective as possible,<!--more--><br />
having thoughts thought through,<br />
and not use &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;me&#8221;, and the subjective angle.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to prefer<br />
to be in the background,<br />
not attract too much attention<br />
both in writing, and in life.</p>
<p>And then I challenge myself,<br />
currently with the daily writing,<br />
which forces me to lay down filters,<br />
to be able to write without it taking<br />
too much time.</p>
<p>So now I choose to try<br />
to be less careful, less thinking<br />
and just write an publish the thoughts<br />
even though it feels very scary<br />
to write more personal.</p>
<p>Being less or more<br />
objective and subjective<br />
has its costs and benefits.</p>
<p>The seemingly objective<br />
is more professional,<br />
and also more safe<br />
by adding the personal distance.<br />
And it also feels more proper<br />
only to focus on the matter<br />
and not oneself.</p>
<p>The subjective<br />
is more vulnerable,<br />
connecting, and scary,<br />
probably better at engaging the reader<br />
as it will feel more personal.<br />
But also more ego-oriented,<br />
which might distract<br />
from the matter at hand.</p>
<p>In my world view,<br />
I have a preconception or feeling,<br />
about the objective is better,<br />
and the subjective being egoistic.</p>
<p>So here I write,<br />
mainly to myself<br />
to say that it is ok,<br />
and might actually<br />
be beneficial<br />
to write more subjective,<br />
more with an offset in<br />
&#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8221;.</p>
