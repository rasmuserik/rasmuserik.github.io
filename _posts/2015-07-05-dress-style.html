<p>I recently decided to discard most of my clothing and start wearing the<!--more--> same every day. This has several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive load, &#8211; I never think about what I will wear</li>
<li>Ease, &#8211; the needed clothing is always in the top of the drawer</li>
<li>Comfort, &#8211;  always wearing the most comfortable clothing</li>
<li>Space, &#8211; it uses a lot less space, (a side effect I only realised afterwards)</li>
<li>Consistent image</li>
<li>Good for travelling</li>
</ul>
<p>What I choose to wear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black t-shirt without label. Merino wool, which is the most comfortable shirt I have worn, can handle dancing or exercising without feeling soaked, and it also looks ok in a suit.</li>
<li>Trousers: I still need to solve this one, &#8211; needs to be usable both for moving/dancing, and semi-formal occasions, and have good pockets.</li>
<li>Extra layers: long johns when cold, and either a jacket or sweater on top of the t-shirt.</li>
<li>Socks, many identical black socks with wool, &#8211; no need for pairing them, and dries easily.</li>
<li>Barefoot shoes, in black leather &#8211; comfortable to walk in, handle rain and wet grass, and are still suitable for semi-formal occasions and dancing.</li>
</ul>
