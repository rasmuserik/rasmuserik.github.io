title: "Idea for simplifying authentication"

<p>What I do want from a login-service: authenticated users should return a public+private-key. I do not care about the login-provider, as long as I get a users pecific public+private key, as that is the thing I need for distributed untrusted apps.</p>
<p>The idea is to implement this as a separate service, that decouples getting a keypair from login-method and login-provider.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>The service itself has two functionalities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide public/private key for authenticated users.</li>
<li>Provide meta-data given a public key, ie. &#8211; reply whether public-key actually represent a verified user</li>
</ol>
<p>The API from the application point of view is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect the user to the login-service website, and after the login, the user will be redirected back to the app, an api-key in the hash, that can be used to retrieve the public/private-key.</li>
<li>REST endpoint forÂ getting the public/private-key given an api-key</li>
<li>REST endpoint for getting meta data given the public key</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficult part is the plethora of login-providers and methods. The nice thing here is that the application itself does not have to know anything about those. Possible methods of login includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unverified username/password</li>
<li>Verified email</li>
<li>Verified sms</li>
<li>Central authority / oauth etc.: github, linkedin, twitter, facebook, google, &#8230;</li>
<li>Local site, ie.: tinkuy, local wordpress, &#8230;</li>
<li>Actual key, etc.</li>
</ul>
