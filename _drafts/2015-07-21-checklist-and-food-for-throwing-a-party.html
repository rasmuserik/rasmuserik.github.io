<p>When I throw party or make events, I often make a check list fo the actual process, and preparation, which makes it a lot easier/approachable. The check list can be like<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>people, &#8211; who, will come and what do they have in common. Also consider who could be relevant for each other, and fit together.</li>
<li>activities, &#8211; things that we might do: board games, jam sessions, dancing, singing, presentations, party games, etc. Think also if there is some activity you can encourage some of the guests to be anchorperson for.</li>
<li>food, &#8211; appetisers, main food, dessert. I think it is often nicer to make a relaxed buffet of various finger-food and small dishes, that you can eat during the event, than a formal dinner etc.</li>
<li>theme and decoration.</li>
</ul>
<p>A concrete example of a check list for food could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buns and biscuits</li>
<li>Strawberry jam and cacao spread</li>
<li>Various cheese</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chocolate covered dried fruits</li>
<li>Almond/data/banana triangle cookies</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hummus</li>
<li>Tomato/garlic dip</li>
<li>Olives with almonds</li>
<li>Pizza-slices</li>
<li>Spring rolls</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I do make these check lists for events etc. I almost never follow them 100%, but they make a very good base for improvisation.</p>
