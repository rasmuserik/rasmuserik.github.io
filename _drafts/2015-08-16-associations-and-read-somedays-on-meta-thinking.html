<p>An interesting explanation of what feeling are, is that they are <!--more-->unfulfilled assumptions about the world, or dissonance between the map and the territory. It could be interesting to think this model through, and also how projections would fit in.</p>
<p>This also leads me to the concept that &#8220;the map is not the territory&#8221; which is the phrase that pops into my mind when thinking about expectations, or the difference between the internal model of the world and the actual world. When I go back to find the origin of that term, I realise that I have mixed up some people, &#8211; I wrongly thought it was Vygotsky, but it turns out that it was Korzybski that coined the phrase about the map not being the territory.</p>
<p>Actually Vygotsky has nothing to do with it, but I would like to mention him nonetheless, because he is still interesting as he introduced the idea of Zone of Proximal Development, ZPD, in a learning context, about where to focus for optimal learning.</p>
<p>Korzybski on the other hand is from a more mathematical / philosophical background and is the father of General Semantics. I have stumbled upon General Semantics before, but have not yet studied enough to understand it, but it is on my lists of things I am curious about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason this also associates into <span class="fn">Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, &#8211; russian mystic approach, remember reading the intro of one of these books, which talks about the way of the yogi, and contrasts it with the western approach to mysticism, &#8211; as far as I remember. Turns out that both Ouspensky and Korzybski are mathematicians, but I do not know if they have anything else in common. (except that I have stumbled upon some of their writings earlier in my life, and it did not really get stuck, other that I thought I I should read ir more some day).</span></p>
<p>Ken Wilbers Integral Theory, also pops up in the same area of the mind, of things in that direction, that I have stumbled on, and thought I should maybe look more into some day.</p>
