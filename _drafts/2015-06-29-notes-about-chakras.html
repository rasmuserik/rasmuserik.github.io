<p>In eastern philosophy there is a concept of chakras. The most common version I have seen is from yoga with <!--more-->7 chakras(<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">चक्र, Sanskrit: round/circle/disc/wheel) or padmas(Sanskrit: lotuses)</span>, but apparently a similar concept exists in Bön with 6 realms of experience, and in some Chinese philosophy with 3 kettles, or dantien(丹田).</p>
<p>A chakra is an energy center along the spine (or above). In addition to the chakra, there are also some energy channels nadis(yoga), meridians(qi-gong). The chakras of the yogi tradition are the following places on the body</p>
<ul>
<li>Mūlādhāra &#8211; root / spine base</li>
<li>Svādhiṣṭhāna &#8211; sacrum</li>
<li>Maṇipūraka &#8211; solar plexus / navel</li>
<li>Anāhata &#8211; heart</li>
<li>Viśuddha &#8211; throat</li>
<li>Ājñā &#8211; the third eye</li>
<li>Sahasrāra &#8211; crown</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a bit confused about the actual number, as the work that describes the chakras is called, Ṣat-cakra-nurūpana, &#8220;Description of the six chakras&#8221; (which I have not read yet), &#8211; but that is probably because the seventh is special.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word &#8220;chakra&#8221;, comes from Proto-indo-European &#8220;*kʷékʷlos&#8221;, which also descended into &#8220;*hwehwlą&#8221; in Germanic, which is quite similar to &#8220;wheel&#8221;, or Old Norse &#8220;hvél&#8221;(singular, plural: &#8220;hjól&#8221;) which is just &#8220;hjul&#8221; in Danish. All of which mean wheel.</p>
<p>When entering sanskrit transliteration on linux, set up with an english-mac-keyboard-layout, overbar can be composed with meta+shift+&#8221;,&#8221; followed by the letter, fōō, and underdot can be composed with meta+shift+&#8221;h&#8221;, ḅạṛ. The other accents are just meta+&#8221;n&#8221;, meta+&#8221;e&#8221;, and meta+shift+&#8221;x&#8221;. Had to copy/paste &#8220;ʷ&#8221;.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am no expert on this topic, and write as a way of learning. it is also outside of my somewhat tradition western scientific view of the world, but interesting nonetheless.</p>
