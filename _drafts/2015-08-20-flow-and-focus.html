<p>It is always a question of prioritising,<br />
now it is time to turn the daily writing<br />
a bit down, &#8211; still continue with the discipline<br />
of writing daily, but shorter, less time.<!--more--></p>
<p>My focus is changing towards<br />
machine languages,<br />
I am back in code-mode.<br />
What is code mode?<br />
&#8211; for me, that is the time<br />
where my focus is on the<br />
structure of the machine.</p>
<p>When in the morning,<br />
during the yoga session,<br />
my mind is creating and solving<br />
algorithmic puzzles,<br />
&#8211; and in the evening,<br />
after dancing, I just need<br />
to check some programming<br />
languageÂ documentation,<br />
and add another plugin.</p>
<p>It is code mode,<br />
when the development<br />
takes over as a passion ðŸ™‚</p>
