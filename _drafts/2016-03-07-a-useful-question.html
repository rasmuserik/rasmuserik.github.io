<p>Will this make me happy?</p>
<p>I have recently begun using this simple question, as a tool for choosing between options at hand.</p>
<p>For example, this question really helps me to not procrastinate, &#8211; if I stop up, and look at what I am doing, and ask myself: Will this make me happy (in the long run), &#8211; then it is easy to stop, and actually change the focus to something more meaningful.</p>
<p>It makes the difference between immediate satisfaction, and long term fulfilment clear: reading some tech-news, browsing the web, or watching a film, or postponing a boring task, might be pleasurable and desired in the moment, &#8211; but asking this question brings the focus back.</p>
