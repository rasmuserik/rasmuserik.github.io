<p><a href="http://owncloud.org">OwnCloud</a> is a cloud storage, that you can run on your own server.<br />
This weekend I decided to set it up for two reasons:<!--more-->1) help my mother back up her data, 2) auto-synchronise the pictures that I take on the phone to the computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> makes it very easy to install. A while ago I configured my server using docker compose, and getting OwnCloud up and running on the server took literally less than 5 minutes, from I got the idea that I wanted to set it up. (Later on I decided to change the config, use another database etc. so that took 15 minutes, and another 45 minutes playing around with the web/desktop/mobile-client(installed via <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.owncloud.android">f-droid</a>)).</p>
