<p>It is a good practise to sit and write down everything you want. It is also a dangerous practise, <!--more-->&#8211; yesterday I went to the place in my notes, where I keep a wishlist, and it was empty. The reason it was empty is that when I really think through what is eligible for a wishlist, then it is either something that I really need (and then get), or something that I do not really need. So even if you do not have any particular occasion, formulating your needs is a good exercise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyhow, I have an occasion, so I am actually make a wishlist, and go through my backlog, and memory, and identify things that I wish for. Some of it is embarrassingly specific and do not open up for much creativity, but my current wishlist is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bits for normal screws for drill</li>
<li>Sangbogen 3</li>
<li>Large transparent stackable plastic boxed for organising stuff in basement</li>
<li>Black wool socks from <a href="http://sortesokker.dk">sortesokker.dk</a> uldsokker str 40-47 (I already use these, but are wearing them out, so need a larger supply, &#8211; by the way: super idea to only have the same kind of socks, as you never need to pair them)</li>
<li>Low open trays/boxes for easy access to kitchen shelves, depth ca. &lt;37cm, width ca. &lt;24cm</li>
<li>Shoes: either giftcard for  <a href="http://naturligfod.dk">naturligfod.dk</a> or Vivo Barefoot RA II leather, size 45m</li>
<li>Something small with a story, (previous examples include a bowl from a friend, a keychain from a couchsurfer, homemade potholders from my sister, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have some non-wishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No wine, &#8211; I almost never drink, nor use it in cooking</li>
<li>No chocolate, &#8211; I prefer to make my own (dipping dried fruit etc. in melted dark chocolate).</li>
<li>No flowers, &#8211; I am not good at appreciating these</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>What I give to others, &#8211; recently I got an idea for gifts that I have begun using: earmarked money that should be used in a specific way, like &#8220;an event/experience&#8221;, &#8220;a private lesson&#8221;, &#8220;music&#8221;, &#8220;a travel&#8221;, &#8220;use it for a gift for somebody&#8221;, &#8220;use it on a festival&#8221;. Ie. trying to initiate an experiential purchase that the receiver desires, or encourage the receiver to give forward, &#8211; as some studies indicates that these are the best ways to use money to increase happiness. Another default gift I often give is some home made chocolate in a bowl(which now due to the occasion has a story).</p>
