<p>When thinking about writing some notes for my son, &#8211; I also start to think about which books that has had a major impact on me, and if there are any common formats to them? I see some patterns, <!--more-->or some kinds of books:</p>
<p>There is the category of books that are good for picking up and reading at random places. The books that consist of pieces that can be read independently, even though the entire book also might have a common aim. Some of the books of this kind that jumps into my mind is &#8220;Tao Te King&#8221;, &#8220;Gayan, Nirtan, Vadan&#8221;, and &#8220;Zen Flesh, Zen Bones&#8221;, but I also remember having enjoyed more easy-going books of this form.</p>
<p>Another category of books that I notice that I like a lot, are telling a story about a single person. Typically a journey of learning or development. Some examples with mystic aspects are Hesse&#8217;s Siddhartha, Richard Bach&#8217;s Illusions, Carlos Castaneda&#8217;s series, and Coelho&#8217;s Alchemist. And then there are more secular ones like the autobiographies of Giacomo Casanova, and Benjamin Franklin.</p>
