title: "An efficient weekday"

<p>There are days with my son,<br />
there are days with events or plans,<br />
and then there are normal weekdays<br />
where I <!--more-->focus on my work.</p>
<p>Focussing on your own work takes discipline,<br />
some days are efficient, others are slow,<br />
&#8211; so what does a good workday look like?<br />
This question is interesting for me<br />
as a way to optimize my own days,<br />
&#8211; and I know I would also be curious about<br />
other people structure their day and life,<br />
so therefore I choose to share mine.</p>
<p>A good weekday for me would be like:<br />
I get up at 6:30, eat some oatmeal,<br />
and next I go biking, thinking/meditating<br />
followed by some yoga or exercise.<br />
Home again, prepare water and food,<br />
and then start working:<br />
&#8211; first the administrative chores,<br />
then writing and studying,<br />
and after that go on into<br />
the actual  working/coding.<br />
When afternoon/evening arrives,<br />
have some free time for cooking,<br />
eating, practical stuff<br />
and then social/dancing for a while,<br />
(either at home or going out,<br />
and sometimes during day instead of evening)<br />
before getting back home to sleep.</p>
<p>So the 24 hours of an efficient weekday could consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 hour of meditating / thinking</li>
<li>1½ hour of yoga or exercising</li>
<li>1 hour of adminstrative business stuff (email, backlog/plan/review)</li>
<li>1 hour of studying/practicing/writing</li>
<li>5 hours of actual working</li>
<li>2½ hours of social dancing</li>
<li>1 hour of biking/transport</li>
<li>3 hours of breaks and including cooking, eating, housework, etc.</li>
<li>8 hours of sleeping</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you spend your day?</p>
