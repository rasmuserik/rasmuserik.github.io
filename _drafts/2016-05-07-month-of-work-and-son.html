<p>When things are busy,<br />
one of the best things to do,<br />
is to stop for a moment,look at the tasks,<br />
decide where to focus<br />
at drop everything else.</p>
<p>This month is such a time for me,<br />
and I will temporarily suspend,<br />
all my other projects, habits etc.,only focus on the most critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>work-projects with deadline soon (the DBC contracting and FM-tools)</li>
<li>time my son (his mother is busy with exams)</li>
<li>partly keeping my body in shape (cycling as transport and some dancing)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
