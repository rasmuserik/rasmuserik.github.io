<p>Sometimes I listen to audio books, when doing various stuff. Recently I heard &#8220;The Virgin Way&#8221;, and three points that I felt was good to be reminded of was:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity,&#8221; &#8211; which is actually a quote from Seneca, which is very worthwhile to remember. This also reminds me that I want to look more into Seneca.</li>
<li>&#8220;Screw it, let&#8217;s do it&#8221; &#8211; a recurrent mantra in the book, which has a good attitude.</li>
<li>Taking notes &#8211; which reminds me, to try to bring a notebook along, so I can capture ideas etc., and to try to make it a daily habit to empty it into an searchable/electronic form in my general note system.</li>
</ul>
